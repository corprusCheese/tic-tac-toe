<h1>Tic-tac-toe</h1>

this is my first pet project in scala, my first try, so don't expect master class code here

it is fullstack application with Svelte frontend and Scala backend (this is the last time i do fullstack applications - frontend and backend should be two different projects)

project has modules

- core (here lies common things like traits or custom data structures)
- tic-tac-toe game using cats and http4s
- websocket chat using cats and fs2

also it has some unit test in src/test/scala directory

master branch deployed to heroku, link below

https://peaceful-depths-92861.herokuapp.com

it should be improved some day, because code is far from ideal
